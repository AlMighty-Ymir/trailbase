# JS/TS Client for TrailBase

TrailBase is a [blazingly](https://trailbase.io/reference/benchmarks/) fast,
single-file, open-source application server with type-safe APIs, built-in
JS/ES6/TS Runtime, Auth, and Admin UI built on Rust+SQLite+V8.

For more context, documentation, and an online demo, check out our website
[trailbase.io](https://trailbase.io).

This is the first-party client for hooking up your PWA, SPAs and JS backend
applications with TrailBase.
While we're working on better documentation, an example setup can be found under
[`/examples/blog/web`](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/tree/main/examples/blog/web)
in the repository.
