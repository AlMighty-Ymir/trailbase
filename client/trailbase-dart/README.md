# TrailBase client library for Dart and Flutter

TrailBase is a blazingly fast, single-file, and open-source server for your
application with type-safe restful APIs, auth, admin dashboard, etc.

For more context, documentation, and an online live demo, check out our website
[trailbase.io](https://trailbase.io).

This is the first-party client for hooking up your Flutter or Dart applications
with your TrailBase server.
While working on documentation, an example setup can be found under
[`/examples/blog/flutter`](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase/tree/main/examples/blog/flutter)
in the repository.
