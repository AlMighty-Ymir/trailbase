  * Replace internal periodic tasks with cron jobs to increase configurability,
    discoverabilty, and avoid drift.
  * BREAKING: removed `backup_interval_sec` from proto config. When explicitly specified,
    users will need to remove it from their `<traildepot>/config.textproto` and set an
    appropriate cron schedule instead.

  parent record into the JSON response of RecordApi `read` and `list`. This is
  also reflected in the JSON schema and warrants a major version update.
  Updates to all the client packages have already been pushed out.
* Support for bulk record creation. This is particularly useful when
  transactional consistency is advisable, e.g. creating a large set of M:N
  dependencies.
* Record subscriptions now have to be explicitly enabled in the
  admin-UI/configuration

## v0.3.0

A foundational overhaul of SQLite's integration and orchestration. This will
unlock more features in the future and already improves performance.
Write performance roughly doubled and read latencies are are down by about two
thirds to sub-milliseconds üèÉ:

* Replaced the libsql rust bindings with rusqlite and the libsql fork of SQLite
  with vanilla SQLite.
 * The bindings specifically are sub-par as witnessed by libsql-server itself
   using a forked rusqlite.
 * Besides some missing APIs like `update_hooks`, which we require for realtime
   APIs in the future, the implemented execution model is not ideal for
   high-concurrency.
 * The libsql fork is also slowly getting more and more outdated missing out on
   recent SQLite development.
 * The idea of a more inclusive SQLite is great but the manifesto hasn't yet
   manifested itself. It seems the owners are currently focused on
   libsql-server and another fork called limbo. Time will tell, we can always
   revisit.

Other breaking changes:

* Removed Query APIs in favor of JS/TS APIs, which were added in v0.2. The JS
  runtime is a lot more versatile and provides general I/O. Moreover, query APIs
  weren't very integrated yet, for one they were missing an Admin UI. We would
  rather spent the effort on realtime APIs instead.
  If you have an existing configuration, you need to strip the `query_apis`
  top-level field to satisfy the textproto parser. We could have left the
  field as deprecated but since there aren't any users yet, might as well...

Other changes:

* Replaced libsql's vector search with sqlite-vec.
* Reduced logging overhead.

## v0.2.6

* Type JSON more strictly.
* Fix input validation for nullable columns in the insert/edit row Admin UI form.

## v0.2.5

* Addresses issues reported by reddit user *qwacko* üôè
  * Fix serialization of foreign key column options.
  * Fix deserialization of TableIndex.
  * Admin UI: Show all tables, including hidden ones, in create-table-form's
    drop down for column foreign-keys.

## v0.2.4

* Allow configuring S3 compatible storage backend for file uploads.

## v0.2.3

* Interleaving of multiple HTTP requests into busy v8 isolates/workers.
* JS runtime:
  *  add `addPeriodicCallback` function to register periodic tasks that
     executes on a single worker/isolate.
  *  Constrain method TS argument type (`MethodType`).

## v0.2.2

* Enable "web" APIs in JS runtime.
* Add "Facebook" and "Microsoft" OAuth providers.

## v0.2.1

* Allow setting the number V8 isolates (i.e. JS runtime threads) via

  * Enables the registration of custom HTML end-points
  * Provides database access.
  * In the future we'd like to add more life-cycles (e.g. scheduled
    operations).
  * In our [micro-benchmarks](https://trailbase.io/reference/benchmarks/) V8
    was about 45x faster than goja.
* Added official C#/.NET client. Can be used with MAUI for cross-platform
  mobile and desktop development.
