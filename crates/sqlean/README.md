# TrailBase Sqlean

A build wrapper around the wonderful
[sqlean](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean) SQLite extensions.

NOTE: This crates is not intended for general use, at least for now. It
currently only builds a subset of sqlean's "define" feature to be used in
[TrailBase](https://trailbase.io).
