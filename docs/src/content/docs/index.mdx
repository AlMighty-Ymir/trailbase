    <Aside type="caution" title="Early Days">
      TrailBase is very young.
      You can expect many new features but also moving APIs until things settle.
      We'll make sure to follow semantic versioning and welcome brave, early
      adopters.

    <Card title="Performance" icon="rocket">
      Blazingly fast thanks to its constituents:

      * Rust: one of the lowest overhead languages,
      * Axum: one of the fastest HTTP servers,
      * SQLite/Libsql: one of the fastest full-SQL databases.

      TrailBase is [6-7x faster than PocketBase and 15x faster than SupaBase
      needing only a fraction of the footprint](/reference/benchmarks), allowing
      you to serve millions of customers from a tiny box.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Simple" icon="heart">
      TrailBase is a small, single file, static binary that is incredibly easy
      to deploy **consistently** across integration testing, development, pre-prod,
      and production environments including edge.
      Architecturally, TrailBase aims to be a simple, thin abstraction around
      standards helping full or piece-meal adoption and avoiding lock-in.

      A simple architecture, both in your dependencies and your own App, will
      let you move faster, more confidently and pivot when necessary.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Admin Dashboard" icon="setting">
      TrailBase ships with a builtin admin dashboard UI, see demo above, that
      lets you quickly configure your instance and visually explore your data.
      Following TrailBase's mantra of not getting in your way, the UI is
      entirely optional letting you fall back to a purely config &
      migration-based setup for integration tests or managing an entire fleet
      of deployments.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Authentication" icon="open-book">
      TrailBase comes with an authentication system and UI built-in supporting
      both password-based and Social/OAuth (Google, Discord, ...) sign-ups.

      TrailBase authentication system follows standards and best-practices
      combining short-lived, stateless JSON web tokens with long-lived stateful
      refresh tokens letting you easily and efficiently authenticate your users
      from any of your other back-ends relying on safe, asymmetric cryptography.
    </Card>

    <Card title="APIs & File Storage" icon="random">
      Provide access to your tables and views through fast, flexible and
      **type-safe** restful CRUD APIs.
      Authorize users based on ACLs and SQL access rules letting you
      easily build higher-level access management or moderation facilities
      like groups or capabilities.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Integration" icon="puzzle">
      Straightforward integration with any stack thanks to thin abstractions,
      reliance on standards, and JSON Schema for type-safety allowing type-safe
      bindings for virtually any language.

      Clients as well as code-generation examples for TypeScript,
      Dart/Flutter, and C#/.NET are provided out of the box.
