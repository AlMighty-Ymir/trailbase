description: Comparing TrailBase & SupaBase.
---

Both SupaBase and Postgres are amazing. Comparing either to TrailBase and
SQLite, respectively, is challenging given how different they are
architecturally.

For one, both Postgres and SupaBase are heck of a lot more modular. "Rule 34" of
the database world: if you can think of it, there's a Postgres extension for it.
And SupaBase does an excellent job at making all that flexibility available
without getting in the way and giving you untethered access while further
expanding upon it.
In many ways, TrailBase is trying to eventually do the same for SQLite:
combining PocketBase's simplicity with SupaBase's layering.

One foundational difference is that Postgres itself is a multi-user,
client-server architecture already.
Extending it by building a layered services around it, like SupaBase did,
feels very natural.
However, SQLite is neither a multi-user system nor a server. Hence, extending
it by embedding it into a monolith, like PocketBase did,  feels fairly natural
as well.
There are ups and downs to either approach. The layered service approach, for
example, allows for isolated failure domains and scaling of individual
components [^1]. The monolith, on the other hand, with its lesser need for modularity
can have fewer interaction points, fewer moving parts making it fundamentally
simpler, cheaper, and
[lower overhead (10+x performance difference)](/reference/benchmarks).

Ultimately, the biggest difference is that SupaBase is a polished product with
a lot of mileage under its belt. Our simpler architecture will hopefully let us
get there but for now SupaBase is our north star.

[^1]:
    For example, in our performance testing we've found that PostgREST,
    SupaBase's RESTful API layer in front of Postgres, is relatively resource
    hungry. This might not be an issue since one can simply scale by pointing
    many independent instances at the same database instance.
