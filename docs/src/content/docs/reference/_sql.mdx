description: A short intro to SQL.

SQL is a functional general-purpose query language for relational databases. It
is as old as relational databases themselves.
It allows to define arbitrary data look-ups and computations w/o hard-coding a
specific database implementation or storage structure (presence of indexes,
storage layout, ...).
Yet many foster a love-hate relationship with it, which has given rise to an
entire cottage industry of ORMs: higher-level, often type-safe abstractions
with bindings for your favorite programming language.
They tend to work great until you need to break glass. In recent years, there
has been a push to thinner and thinner abstractions.

Instead of hiding or working around SQL, TrailBase embraces it as an evergreen,
transferable skill.
There's no denying that SQL can get tricky but it's
also its greatest strength. SQL is a general purpose functional (sometimes
imperative) programming language that lets you solve arbitrary problems in a
high-level, portable fashion. In other words, learning SQL is a lot more useful
than learning a specific ORM or similar abstractions.

One thing that's pretty sweet about SQL is that, almost any relational database
(Postgres, MySQL, MS SQL, sqlite, ...) supports some dialect of SQL, which
makes this a pretty transferable skill. This is only possible because SQL is
pretty abstract. Given a lookup or transformation, different databases might
execute them quite differently depending on their capabilities, how the data
structures are set up, and how the look is expressed. All of this is facilitate
through the magic of the query-planner, which takes your query and turns it
into a physical execution plan.

## A gentle introduction

At first glance, SQL may look just like some antiquated filter language but in
practice it's a high-level, functional programming language that is optimized
for table transformations. All that SQLs does is:

1. inserting rows (INSERT),
2. removing rows (DELETE),
3. updating rows (UPDATE),
4. and transforming NxM tables into PxQ tables (SELECT).

5. to 3. are pretty simple, they operate on rows.

SELECT is by far the most complex tool, think of it as writing a function that
takes in one or more table, even combined tables, filters them, and them
transforms them into a new table. They might look overwhelming at first:

```sql
SELECT
  Output: outcol0, outcol1, ..
FROM
  Input: incol0, incol1,
WHERE Filter: e.g. where incol0 > 10
ORDER BY outcol0 ASC
GROUP BY aggregation
;
```

but most of it is optional. The simplest statement is `SELECT 1;`, it creates a
new table with one row and one column containing the value of `1` (a scalar)
from nothing.

Now that we can create a new column from thin air, let's transform it:

```sql
SELECT col*2 FROM (SELECT 1 as col);
```

Now we created two nested SELECTs, inner one creates the table we already know
but names the column `col` and the outer SELECT transforms that table into a
new 1x1 table with the values doubled.
