TrailBase is merely the sum of its parts. It's the result of marrying one of
the lowest-overhead languages, one of the fastest HTTP servers, and one of the
lightest relational SQL databases, while merely avoiding extra expenditures.
We did expect it to go fast but how fast exactly? Let's take a brief look at
how TrailBase performs compared to a few amazing, and more weathered
alternatives such as SupaBase, PocketBase, and vanilla SQLite.

## Disclaimer

In general, benchmarks are tricky, both to do well and to interpret.
Benchmarks never show how fast something can theoretically go but merely how
fast the author managed to make it go.
Micro-benchmarks, especially, offer a selective key-hole insights, which may be
biased and may or may not apply to your workload.

Performance also doesn't exist in a vacuum. If something is super fast but
doesn't do what you need it to do, performance is an illusive luxury.
Doing less makes it naturally easier to go fast, which is not a bad thing,
however means that comparing a highly specialized solution to a more general
one on a specific aspect can be misleading or "unfair".
Specifically, PocketBase and SupaBase have both been around for longer offering
a different and in many cases more comprehensive features.

We tried our hardest to give all contenders the best chance to go fast [^1].
We were surprised by the performance gap ourselves and thus went back and
forth. We suspect that any overhead weighs so heavily because of how quick
SQLite itself is.
If you spot any issues or have ideas to make anyone go faster,
[we want to know](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase-benchmark).
We hope to improve the methodology over time, make the numbers more broadly
applicable, and as fair as an apples-to-oranges comparison can be.
With that said, we hope that the results can provide at least some insights
into what to expect when taken with a grain of salt.
Ultimately, nothing beats benchmarking your own workload and setup.

## Insertion Benchmarks

_Total Time for 100k Insertions_

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[300px] w-[90%]">
    <Duration100kInsertsChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

The graph shows the overall time it takes to insert 100k messages into a mock
"chat-room" table setup. Less time is better.

Unsurprisingly, in-process SQLite is the quickest [^2].
All other setups add additional table look-ups for access checking, IPC
overhead[^3], and layers of features on top.
Maybe think of this data point as an upper bound to how fast SQLite could go
and the cost a project would pay by adopting any of the systems over in-process
SQLite.

The data suggests that depending on your setup (client, data, hardware)
TrailBase can insert 100k records 9 to 16 times faster than SupaBase[^4] and
roughly 6 to 7 times faster than PocketBase [^1].
The fact that our TS/node.js benchmark is slower than the Dart one, suggests a
client-side bottleneck that could be overcome by tuning the setup or trying
other JS runtimes with lower overhead HTTP clients.

Total time of inserting a large batch of data tells only part of the story,
let's have a quick look at resource consumption to get an intuition for
provisioning or footprint requirements:

_TrailBase & PocketBase Utilization_

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[300px] w-[90%]">
    <PocketBaseAndTrailBaseUsageChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

The graph shows the CPU utilization and memory consumption (RSS) of both
PocketBase and TrailBase. They look fairly similar apart from TrailBase
finishing earlier. They both load roughly 3 CPUs with PocketBase's CPU
consumption being slightly more variable [^5].
The little bump after the TrailBase run is likely due to SQLite check-pointing.

Both only consume about 140MB of memory at full tilt, which makes them a great
choice for running on a tiny VPS or a toaster.

SupaBase is a bit more involved due to it's
[layered architecture](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture)
including a dozen separate services that provide a ton of extra functionality:

_SupaBase Memory Usage_

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[340px] w-[90%]">
    <SupaBaseMemoryUsageChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

Looking at SupaBase's memory usage, it increased from from roughly 6GB at rest to
7GB fully loaded.
This means that out of the box, SupaBase has roughly 50 times the memory
footprint of either PocketBase or TrailBase.
In all fairness, there's a lot of extra functionality and it might be possible
to further optimize the setup by shedding some less critical services, e.g.
removing "supabase-analytics" may safe ~40% of memory. That said, we don't know
how feasible this is in practice.

_SupaBase CPU utilization_

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[340px] w-[90%]">
    <SupaBaseCpuUsageChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

Looking at the CPU usage You can see how the CPU usage jumps up to roughly 9
cores (the benchmark ran on a machine with 8 physical cores and 16 threads:
7840U). Most of the CPUs seem to be consumed by "supabase-rest" with postgres
itself hovering at only ~0.7.

## Latency and Read Performance

In this chapter we'll take a closer look at latency distributions. To keep
things manageable we'll focus on PocketBase and TrailBase, which are
architecturally simpler and more comparable.

Reads were on average 3.5 faster with TrailBase and insertions 6x as discussed
above.

<div class="flex justify-center h-[340px] w-[90%]">
  <div class="w-[50%]">
    <PocketBaseAndTrailBaseReadLatencies client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>

  <div class="w-[50%]">
    <PocketBaseAndTrailBaseInsertLatencies client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

Looking at the latency distributions we can see that the spread is well
contained for TrailBase. For PocketBase, read latencies are also generally well
contained and predictable.
However, insert latencies show a more significant "long tail" with their p90
being roughly 5x longer than therr p50.
Slower insertions can take north of 100ms. There may or may not be a connection
to the variability in CPU utilization we've seen above.

## JavaScript-Runtime Benchmarks

The [benchmarks](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase-benchmark)
implement a custom HTTP endpoint `/fibonacci?n=<N>` calculating Fibonacci
numbers, both within PocketBase and TrailBase.
We use Fibonacci numbers as a proxy for a computationally heavy workload to
primarily benchmark the performance of the underlying JavaScript engines:
[goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) for PocketBase and V8 for TrailBase.
In other words, any difference in performance is dominated by the engines'
performance rather than PocketBase or TrailBase themselves.

{/*
    Output:
      TB: Called "/fibonacci" for fib(40) 100 times, took 0:00:14.988703 (limit=64)
      PB: Called "/fibonacci" for fib(40) 100 times, took 0:10:01.096053 (limit=64)
*/}

We found that for `fib(40)` V8 (TrailBase) is around *40x faster* than
goja (PocketBase):

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <div class="h-[300px] w-[90%]">
    <FibonacciPocketBaseAndTrailBaseUsageChart client:only="solid-js" />
  </div>
</div>

Interestingly, PocketBase seems to have an initial warm-up of ~30s where it
doesn't parallelize. That said, even after starting to use all available cores
finishing the overall task takes significantly longer.
Note further that with the addition of V8 to TrailBase we've experienced a
significant increase in baseline memory dominating the overall footprint.
If memory footprint is your main concern, reducing the number of V8 workers
will be very effective.

## Final Words

We're very happy to confirm that TrailBase is quick. The significant
performance gap we observed might just be a consequence of how much overhead
matters given how quick SQLite itself is.
Yet, it challenges our intuition. With the numbers fresh of the press, prudence is
of the essence. We'd like to re-emphasize how important it is to run your own
tests with your specific setup and workloads.
In any case, we hope this was interesting nonetheless and let us know if you
see anything that can or should be improved.
The benchmarks are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/trailbaseio/trailbase-benchmark).

[^1]:
    Trying to give PocketBase the best chance, the binary was built with the
    latest go compiler (v1.23.1 at the time of writing), `CGO_ENABLED=1` (which
    according to PB's own documentation will use a faster C-based SQLite
    driver) and `GOAMD64=v4` (for less portable but more aggressive CPU
    optimizations).
    We found this setup to be roughly 20% faster than the static, pre-built
    binary release.

[^2]:
    Our setup with drizzle and node.js is certainly not the fastest possible.
    For example, we could drop down to using raw SQLite in C or another
    low-level language.
    That said, drizzle is a great popular choice which mostly serves as a
    point-of-reference and sanity check.

[^3]:
    The actual magnitude on IPC overhead will depend on the communication cost.
    For the benchmarks at hand we're using a loopback network device.

[^4]:
    The SupaBase benchmark setup skips row-level access checks. Technically,
    this is in its favor from a performance standpoint, however looking at the
    overall load on its constituents with PG being only a sliver, it probably
    would not make much of an overall difference nor would PG17's vectorization,
    which has been released since the benchmarks were run. That said, these
    claims deserve re-validation.

[^5]:
    We're unsure as to what causes these 1-core swings.
    Runtime-effects, such as garbage collection, may have an effect, however we
    would have expected these to show on shorter time-scales.
    This could also indicate a contention or thrashing issue 🤷.
