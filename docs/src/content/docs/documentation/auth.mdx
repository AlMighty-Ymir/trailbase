TrailBase provides core authentication flows and a basic UI out of the box[^1].
These primitives let you establish the identity of your users in order to
authorize or deny access to your data, let users change their email address,
reset their password, etc.

<Aside type="danger" title="HTTPs">
  The safety of any authentication flow hinges on TLS/HTTPS, both for your users
  to trust that the server they're talking to is yours and for credentials to be
  transferred encrypted. Otherwise, credentials will be transmitted in plain
  text. In production, use a reverse proxy like nginx, caddy, or similar for TLS
  termination, see [here](/documentation/production).

## Implementation

TrailBase tries to offer a standard, safe and versatile auth implementation out
of the box. It combines:

- Asymmetric cryptography based on elliptic curves (ed25519)
- Stateless, short-lived auth tokens (JWT)
- Stateful, long-lived, opaque refresh tokens.

Breaking this apart, __asymmetric cryptography__ means that tokens signed with a
private key by the TrailBase "auth server", which can then be validated by
others ("resource servers") using only the corresponding public key.
The __Statelesss JWTs__ contain metadata that identities the user w/o having to
talk to the auth server.
Combining the two, other back-ends can authenticate, validate & identify, users
hermetically.
This is very easy and efficient, however means that hermetic auth tokens cannot
be invalidated.
A hermetic auth token released into the wild is valid until it expires.
To balance the risks and benefits, TrailBase uses short-lived auth tokens
expiring frequently[^2].
To avoid burdening users by constantly re-authenticating, TrailBase issues an
additional __opaque, stateful refresh token__.
Refresh tokens are simply a unique identifier the server keeps track of as
sessions.
Only refresh tokens that have not been revoked can be exchanged for a new auth
token.

## Flows & UI

TrailBase currently implements the following auth flows:

- Email + password based user registration and email verification.
- User registration using social OAuth providers (Google, ...)
- Login & logout.
- Change & reset password.
- Change email.
- User deletion.
- Avatar management.

Besides the flows above, TrailBase also ships with a set of simple UIs to
support the above flows. By default it's accessible via the route:
`<url>/_/auth/login`. Check out the [demo](https://demo.trailbase.io/_/auth/login).
The built-in auth UIs can be disabled with `--disable-auth-ui` in case you
prefer rolling your own or have no need web-based authentication.

## Usernames and other metadata

Strictly speaking, authentication is merely responsible for uniquely
identifying who's on the other side.
This only requires a __unique identifier__ and one or more __secrets__
(e.g.  a password, hardware token, ...) for the peer to proof they're them.

Any unique identifier will do: a random string (painful to remember), a phone
number, a username, or an email address.
Email addresses are a popular choice, since they do double duty as a
communication channel letting you reach out to your users, e.g. to reset their
password.

Even from a product angle, building an online shop for example, email addresses
are the natural choice.
Asking your customers to think up and remember a globally unique username adds
extra friction especially since you need their email address anyway to send
receipts.
Additional profile data, like a shipment address, is something you can ask for
at a later time and is independent from auth.
In contrast, when building a social network, chat app or messaging board, you
typically don't want to leak everyone's email address.
You will likely want an additional, more opaque identifier such as a username
or handle.

Long story short, modeling __profile__ data is very product dependent.
It's for you to figure out.
That said, it is straight forward to join auth data, such as the user's email
address, and custom custom profile data in TrailBase.
We suggest creating a separate profile table with a `_user.id` `FOREIGN KEY`
primary key column. You can then freely expose profiles as dedicated record API
endpoints or join them with other data `_user.id`.
The blog example in `<repo>/examples/blog` demonstrates this, joining blog
posts with user profiles on the author id to get an author's name.
