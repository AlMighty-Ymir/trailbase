Query APIs are a more free-form and type-unsafe way of exposing data using
virtual tables based on user inputs and stored procedures. Please make sure to
take a look at [record APIs](/documentation/apis/record_apis) first. Views and
generated columns may be a better fit for transforming data if no explicit user
input is required.

<Aside type="note" title="Note">
  Query APIs fill a gap that in other frameworks is often filled by custom
  handlers. TrailBase may go this direction as well either with custom Axum
  handlers or embedding another runtime. At least for the time being Query APIs
  based on stored procedures are simply a very constrained (e.g. read-only) and
  performant way to achieve similar goals.

## Example

Using migrations and sqlean's `define` we can define a table query with unbound
inputs (see placeholder $1):

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE
  _is_editor
USING
  define((SELECT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM editors WHERE user = $1) AS is_editor));
```

Subsequently, an API can be configured to query the newly created `VIRTUAL
TABLE`, also binding URL query parameters as inputs to above placeholders.

```proto
query_apis: [
  {
    name: "is_editor"
    virtual_table_name: "_is_editor"
    params: [
      {
        name: "user"
        type: BLOB
      }
    ]
    acl: WORLD
  }
]
```

Finally, we can query the API, e.g. using curl:

```bash
curl -g 'localhost:4000/api/query/v1/is_editor?user=<b64_user_id>'
```
