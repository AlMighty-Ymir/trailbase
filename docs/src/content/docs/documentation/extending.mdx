This article explores different ways to extend TrailBase and integrate your own
custom logic.

## The Elephant in the Room

The question on where your code should run is as old as the modern internets
becoming ever present since moving away from a static mainframe model and
hermetic desktop applications.
With pushing more interactive applications to slow platforms, such as early
browsers or mobile phone, there was an increased need to distribute
applications with interactivity happening in the front-end and heavy lifting
happening in a back-end.
That's not to say that there aren't other good reasons to not just run all your
code in an untrusted, potentially slow client-side sandbox.

In any case, having a rich client-side application like a mobile, desktop or
progressive web apps will reduce your need for server-side integrations.
They're often a good place to start [^1], even if over time you decide to move more
logic to a backend to address issues like high fan-out, initial load
times, and SEO for web applications.

Inversely, if you have an existing application that is mostly running
server-side, you probably already have a database, auth, and are hosting your
own APIs, ... .
If so, there's intrinsically less any application base can help you with.
Remaining use-cases might be piece-meal adoption to speed up existing APIs or
delegate authentication.
One advantage of lightweight, self-hosted solutions is that they can be
co-locate with your existing stack to reduce costs and latency.

## Bring your own Backend

The most flexible and likewise de-coupled way of running your own code is to
deploy a separate service alongside TrailBase. This gives you full control over
your destiny: runtime, scaling, deployment, etc.

TrailBase is designed with the explicit goal of running along a sea of other
services.
Its stateless tokens using asymmetric crypto make it easy for other resource
servers to hermetically authenticate your users.
TrailBase's APIs can be accessed transitively, simply by forwarding user
tokens.
Alternatively, you can fall back to raw SQLite for reads, writes and even
schema alterations[^2].

<Aside type="note" title="Service Accounts">
  We would like to add service accounts in the future to authorize privileged
  services independent from user-provided tokens or using fake user-accounts
  for services.

## Custom APIs in TrailBase

TrailBase provides three main ways to embed your code and expose custom APIs:

1. Rust/Axum handlers.
2. Stored procedures & [Query APIs](/documentation/apis/query_apis/)
3. SQLite extensions, virtual table modules & [Query APIs](/documentation/apis/query_apis/)

Beware that the Rust APIs and [Query APIs](/documentation/apis/query_apis/) are
likely subject to change. We rely on semantic versioning to explicitly signal
breaking changes.
Eventually, we would like to lower the barrier of entry by providing stable
bindings to a higher-level runtime within TrailBase, likely a
TypeScript/ES6/JavaScript runtime.

### Using Rust

The Rust APIs aren't yet stable and fairly undocumented.
That said, similar to using PocketBase as a Go framework, you can build your
own TrailBase binary and register custom Axum handlers written in rust with the
main application router, see `/examples/custom-binary`.

### Stored Procedures & Query APIs

Unlike Postgres or MySQL, SQLite does not supported stored procedures out of
the box.
TrailBase has adopted sqlean's
[user-defined functions](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/docs/define.md)
to provide similar functionality and minimize lock-in over vanilla SQLite.
Check out [Query APIs](/documentation/apis/query_apis/), to see how stored
procedures can be hooked up.

### SQLite extensions, virtual table modules  & Query APIs

Likely the most bespoke approach is to expose your functionality as a custom
SQLite extension or module similar to how TrailBase extends SQLite itself.

This approach can be somewhat limiting in terms of dependencies you have
access to and things you can do especially for extensions. Modules are quite a bit
more flexible but also involved.
Take a look at [SQLite's list](https://www.sqlite.org/vtablist.html) and
[osquery](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to get a sense of what's
possible.

Besides their limitations, major advantages of using extensions or
modules are:
* you have extremely low-overhead access to your data,
* extensions and modules can also be used by services accessing the
  underlying SQLite databases.

[^1]:
    There are genuinely good properties in terms of latency, interactivity, offline
    capabilities and privacy when processing your users' data locally on their
    device.

[^2]:
    SQLite is running in WAL mode, which allows for parallel reads and
    concurrent writes. That said, when possible you should probably use the APIs
    since falling back to raw database access is a priviledge practically reserved
    to processes with access to a shared file-system.
