When building any connected application, eventually you'll want to call an API
endpoint:

1. to [read/write some data](#data-apis), or
2. to run some [server-side application logic](#custom-endpoints-inside-trailbase).

Especially for application logic, where and how it should run depends on your
app, your environment, and external requirements.

For example, for rich client-side applications - such as mobile, desktop, and
progressive web apps - it is often a good idea to run inside the user's device.
It is cheap, snappy, privacy-friendly and able to run offline or on a spotty
connection.
That said, there are very valid reasons to not run everything in an untrusted,
resource and battery-limited, hard to update sandbox.

## Data APIs

Data APIs are limited APIs that let you perform a common operations on your
data: **read/list**, **create**, **update** and **delete**.

In the simplest case, you can use TrailBase's [record
APIs](/documentation/apis_record/) to define limited-access APIs over your
`TABLE`s and `VIEW`s.
If you require more flexibility, the following provides an overview of ways to
run arbitrary logic.


## Custom Endpoints inside TrailBase

There are several ways to integrate custom logic into TrailBase, however you
can also run logic outside in your [own backend](#bring-your-own-backend).

Within TrailBase you have the following options:

1. [JS & TS handlers](#javascript--typescript-handlers),
2. [Stored database procedures](#stored-procedures),
3. [Native Rust handlers](#rust-handlers).


### JavaScript & TypeScript Handlers

TrailBase's built-in runtime enables wiring custom HTTP endpoints using full
ES6 JavaScript and/or TypeScript.
For more context, check out the dedicated [docs](/documentation/apis_js/).

### Stored Procedures

Unlike Postgres or MySQL, SQLite does not support stored procedures out of the
box.
TrailBase makes Sqlean's
[user-defined functions](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/docs/define.md)
available to fill the gap.
They can be accessed from record APIs through `VIEW`s or custom handlers.

<Aside type="note" title="Portability">
  Sqlean can be used with any SQLite client, thus avoiding lock-in.
</Aside>

{/* Is this too obtuse to actually be useful?
### SQLite Extensions and Virtual Tables

Likely the most bespoke approach is to expose your functionality as a custom
SQLite extension or module similar to how TrailBase extends SQLite itself.

This approach can be somewhat limiting in terms of dependencies you have
access to and things you can do especially for extensions. Modules are quite a bit
more flexible but also involved.
Take a look at [SQLite's list](https://www.sqlite.org/vtablist.html) and
[osquery](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to get a sense of what's
possible.

Besides their limitations, major advantages of using extensions or
modules are:
* you have extremely low-overhead access to your data,
* extensions and modules can also be used by services accessing the
  underlying SQLite databases.

### Rust Handlers

The Rust APIs aren't yet stable and fairly undocumented.
That said, similar to using PocketBase as a Go framework, you can build your
own TrailBase binary and register custom
[axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) HTTP handlers written in rust with the
main application router, see `/examples/custom-binary`.

<Aside type="note" title="API Stability">
  the Rust APIs are subject to change. However, we will rely on semantic
  versioning to communicate breaking changes explicitly.
</Aside>


## Bring your own Backend

The most flexible and de-coupled way of running your own code is to deploy a
separate service in front of or alongside TrailBase.
This gives you full control over your destiny: language, runtime, scaling,
deployment, etc.

TrailBase is designed with the explicit goal of running along a sea of other
services.
Its stateless tokens using asymmetric crypto make it easy for other resource
servers to hermetically authenticate your users.
TrailBase's APIs can be accessed transitively, simply by forwarding users'
[auth tokens](/documentation/auth/) [^1].

Alternatively, for more of a side-car setup you can fall back to accessing the
SQLite database directly, both for data access and schema alterations[^2].

[^1]:
    We would like to add service accounts in the future to authorize privileged
    services independent from user-provided tokens or using fake user-accounts
    for services.

[^2]:
    SQLite is running in WAL mode, which allows for parallel reads and
    concurrent writes. That said, when possible you should probably use the APIs
    since falling back to raw database access is a priviledge practically reserved
    to processes with access to a shared file-system.
