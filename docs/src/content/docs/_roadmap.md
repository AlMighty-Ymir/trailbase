Over time, we would like to make TrailBase the best application base it can be.
Tell us what's missing, what could be better, and what smells.
Independently, we're very open to contributions, just talk to us first so we
can figure out how any feature will fit into the overall picture and minimize
friction.
For context, some larger features we have on our Roadmap:

- Realtime/notification APIs for subscribing to data changes.
- Auth: more customizable settings, more customizable UI, and multi-factor.
  Also, service-accounts to auth other backends as opposed to end-users.
- Many SQLite databases: imagine a separate database by tenant or user.
- TLS termination and proxy capabilities.
- We might want to address fan-out and the integration of external resources
  through GraphQL or similar.
