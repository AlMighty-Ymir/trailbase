Over time, we would like to make TrailBase the best application base it can be.
Tell us what's missing, what could be better, and what smells.
Independently, we're very open to contributions, just talk to us first so we
can figure out how any feature will fit into the overall picture and minimize
friction.
For context, some larger features we have on our Roadmap:

- Realtime/notification APIs for subscribing to data changes.
- S3 buckets and other cloud storage. The backend already supports it but it isn't wired up.
- Support more Social/OAuth providers.
- More configurable authentication, more customizable auth UI, and multi-factor.
- Service-accounts for authenticating and authorizing backends not end-users.
- Custom scheduled operations. Also enabling more time series use-cases.
- Many SQLite databases: imagine a separate database by tenant or user.
- Maybe integrate an ES6 JavaScript runtime or similar.
- Streamline code-generation, the bindings life-cycle, and first-party
  support for more languages.
- Geo-spatial extensions and Geo-Ip for logs.
- Maybe TLS termination and proxy capabilities.
- Consider a GraphQL layer to address fan-out and integrate external
  resources.
